Much of this document is based on preliminary ideas and concepts from NRC-VLA Expansion Project Memo and previous System Requirement Documents [5] and [9].
The requirements contained in this document are numbered based on the section/subsection in which they appear.

The remainder of this document contains a more detailed description of the Correlator Monitor and Control System as well as the primary requirements necessary to design and build the EVLA Correlator Monitor & Control System.
Section 2 provides a general description of the Correlator Monitor and Control System System.
Section 3 details the require ments of the product and is the core of this document.
The format of the document follows that outlined in the IEEE STD 830 document, IEEE The VLA Expansion Project Correlator Monitor and Control System is responsible for correlator configuration, real time monitor/control, and hardware testing/servicing.
The Correlator Monitor and Control System exists as an integrated part of the overall VLA Expansion Project Monitor and Control Structure.
The Correlator Monitor and Control System will provide a level of abstraction to modularize the correlator system within the VLA Expansion Project environment.
The “gateway” to the correlator will be through the Virtual Correlator Interface (VCI) which will exist as a software entity on the The Correlator Monitor and Control System will be designed and implemented as a Master/Slave network with one computer system coordinating the activities of a number of “intelligent” hardware control processors.
The Master is expected to handle the bulk of the monitor/control interface with the outside world whereas the slaves will be only concerned with the correlator hardware systems under their direct control.
This topology will place the real-time computing requirements in the slave layer and the quasi real-time, network-chaotic loads into the master layer.
One of the primary benefits of this structure is isolation (ease of serviceability, programmability) of the correlator hardware from the the EVLA Correlator Monitor & Control System is expected to be redundant in critical areas and highly modular.
The Correlator monitor subsystem will provide VLA Expansion Project system wide access to all correlator system states (including the Monitor and Control System supervisor system state).
Some of this information will be provided on a time synchronous basis as required by other systems (backend, monitor archive, data archive, etc.) and other information will only be presented on a request basis.
The Correlator Monitor and Control System will be a fully observable system with the only limits placed on information access being those imposed by hardware, bandwidth, and/or security restrictions.
Error and status messages will be provided in a concise time/location referenced format to upper system levels in a content controllable manner.
Correlator configurations and control instructions will be received from the VLA Expansion Project Monitor and Control System system in a form suitable for translation by the Master Correlator Control Computer.
The translation will provide the correlator with specific goal oriented hardware configuration tables to satisfy the configuration requested by the A second interface with a human GUI will also allow for configuration of the correlator hardware, preferably through the same table structures used above.
This translation interface will be called the Virtual Correlator Interface (VCI).
Specific data sets required by the Backend Data Processing System (state counts, auto correlations, etc) will be provided in a timely and robust fashion over a secondary virtual network.
Ancillary monitor data including system health, error messages and configuration echoes will be spooled such that temporary loss of network communication with the VLA Expansion Project Monitor and Control System network will not result in loss of monitor data.
Data sample rates and contents will be fully controllable via either the VLA Expansion Project Monitor and Control System or the Backend processing controller.
The Master Correlator Control Computer will accept external data feeds for models, time standards, fiber-link phase corrections and other required data to be packaged with control data delivered to the correlator hardware.
The ability to attempt recovery from failure or hot-swapped hardware devices will be built into this system.
Should a CMIB subsystem fail and not respond to reboot requests or other self-heal attempts, an alert notice will be issued so appropriate personnel can affect a hardware repair.
The CMIB subsystem will then be automatically restarted and configured back into the current operational environment.
It is intended that both primary and secondary Master Correlator Control Computer systems maintain full Correlator Monitor and Control System state information such that any hard failure (unrecoverable) in the primary node can be corrected by simply rerouting Monitor and Control System communications to the secondary.
Watchdog processes and the Master Correlator Control Computer will likewise monitor Correlator Power Control Computer health.
Due to the more hardware specific connections and controls of the Correlator Power Control Computer, actions taken by external system upon hard failures are TBD.
All use of the Correlator Monitor and Control System will be through the VCI or Master Correlator Control Computer.
Software tools will be provided to assist the user at all access levels from system wide configuration and control to a low level CMIB command line instruction.
The primary contact with array operations will be via status and error messages channeled through the Monitor and Control System.
The ability of the Correlator System to achieve and maintain high reliability and uptime will be vitally dependent upon reliable operation and rapid diagnosis and repair of faults in the hardware and software systems.
These individuals will be responsible for performing corrective and preventive maintenance along with periodic performance tests and upgrades.
Engineers and technicians will need tools to inspect and monitor individual CMIB layer devices from remote locations and have the ability to fault trace to a specific hot-swappable subsystem.
These individuals are responsible for developing the software and will interact with the EVLA Correlator Monitor & Control System to ensure that it is functioning properly.
The software developer requires remote access to the EVLA Correlator Monitor & Control System so that troubleshooting can be accomplished away from the the VLA Expansion Project and during non-working hours.
