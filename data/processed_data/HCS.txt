This document specifies the requirements for the development of a “Smart House”, called DigitalHome (DH), by the DigitalHomeOwner Division of HomeOwner Inc.
A “Smart House” is a home management system that allows home residents to easily manage their daily lives by providing for a lifestyle that brings together security, environmental and energy management (temperature, humidity and lighting), entertainment, and communications.
The Smart House components consist of household devices (e.g., a heating and air conditioning unit, a security system, and small appliances and lighting units, etc.), sensors and controllers for the devices, communication links between the components, and a computer system, which will manage the components.
The DigitalHome Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is based on the DigitalHome Customer Need Statement.
It is made up of a list of the principal features of the system.
This initial version of DigitalHome will be a limited prototype version, which will be used by HomeOwner management to make business decisions about the future commercial development of DigitalHomeOwner products and services.
Hence, the SRS is not intended as a comprehensive or complete specification of DigitalHome requirements.
These document were prepared by the DigitalHomeOwner Division, in consultation with the Marketing Division of HomeOwner Inc.
The Digital Home system, for the purposes of this document, is a system that will allow a home user to manage devices that control the environment of a home.
The user communicates through a personal web page on the DigitalHome web server or on a local home server.
The product is based on the Digital Home High Level Requirements Definition.
The Digital Home High Level Requirements Definition is intended as a prototype, which will allow business decisions to be made about future development of a commercial product.
The scope of the project will be limited to the management of devices which control temperature, humidity, security, and power to small appliances and lighting units, through the use of a web-ready device.
The prototype DigitalHome software system will be situated in a simulated environment.
The general user shall be able to use the DigitalHome system capabilities to monitor and control the environment in his/her home.
The general user is familiar with the layout of his/her home and the location of sensor and control devices (for temperature, for humidity, and for power to small appliances and lighting units).
Although the general user is not familiar with the technical features of the DigitalHome system, he/she is familiar with the use of a web interface and can perform simple web operations (logging in and logging out, browsing web pages, and submitting information and requests via a web interface).
A Master user will be designated, who shall be able to change the configuration of the system.
For example, a Master User shall be able to add a user account or change the default parameter settings.
He/she will have the same right as the DigitalHome Technician.
A DigitalHome Technician is responsible for setting up and maintaining the configuration of a DigitalHome system.
A DigitalHome Technician has experience with the type of hardware, software, and web services associated with a system like the DigitalHome system.
A DigitalHome Technician is specially trained by DigitalHomeOwner to be familiar with the functionality, architecture, and operation of the DigitalHome system product.
A DigitalHome Technician will have rights beyond the DigitalHome General User, capable of setting up and making changes in the configuration of the system (e.g.,setting system parameters and establishing user accounts), and starting and stopping operation of the DigitalHome System.
The “prototype” version of the DigitalHome System (as specified in this document) must be completed within twelve months of inception.
The development team will consist of five engineers.
DigitalHomeOwner Director will provide management and communication support.
The development team will use the development process specified by the Digital HomeOwner Inc.
Where possible, the DigitalHome project will employ widely used, accepted, and available hardware and software technology and standards, both for product elements and for development tools.
Because of potential market competition for DigitalHome products, the cost of DigitalHome elements (sensors, controllers, server, tools, etc.), for this project should be minimized.
The DigitalHome system will be tested in a simulated environment.
However, the simulated environment will be realistic and adhere to the physical properties and constraints of an actual home and to real sensors and controllers.
Major changes to this document (e.g., changes in requirements) must be approved by the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner Division.
Although the system to be developed is a “proof of concept” system intended to help Homeowner Inc.

All DigitalHome operations shall incorporate exception handling so that the system responds to a user with a clear, descriptive message when an error or an exceptional condition occurs.
Although there are no specific safety requirements, high system reliability is important to insure there are no system failures in carrying out user requests.
Such failures might affect the safety of home dwellers (e.g., security breaches, inadequate lighting in dark spaces, inappropriate temperature and humidity for people who are in ill-health, or powering certain appliances when young children are present).
Upon installation, a DigitalHome user account shall be established.
